2. Suggest potential fixes or mitigation if you have any.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**.
4. We aim to provide an initial response to vulnerability reports within **5 working days**, including a plan for remediation and any timeline details.

## Security Updates

We regularly use **Dependabot** to keep our dependencies updated, including security-related patches. If a high-severity vulnerability affects any part of the project, an immediate hotfix release will be scheduled.

## Best Practices for Users

- **Update Regularly**: Ensure that your local copy of the project is kept up-to-date to receive the latest security patches.
